# PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration

## Project Description
This project aims to extract, transform, and visualize data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository, providing insights into digital payment habits in India. The project utilizes Python, Pandas, MySQL, Streamlit, and Plotly for data processing and visualization.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- MySQL
- mysql-connector-python
- Streamlit
- Plotly
- Git

## Domain
Fintech

## Problem Statement
The PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository contains a large amount of data related to digital payments. The goal of this project is to extract this data, process it, and create an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends.

## Approach
1. **Data Extraction:** Clone the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository using Python scripting.
2. **Data Transformation:** Use Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
3. **Database Insertion:** Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database using mysql-connector-python.
4. **Dashboard Creation:** Use Streamlit and Plotly to create an interactive dashboard for data visualization.
5. **Data Retrieval:** Fetch data from MySQL database to dynamically update the dashboard.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy the dashboard to a web server for public access.

## Dataset
The dataset is available in the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository.

## Learning Outcomes
- Data extraction and processing
- Database management
- Visualization and dashboard creation
- Geo visualization
- Dynamic updating
- Project development and deployment

## Evaluation Metrics
- Modular code
- Maintainability
- Portability
- Proper documentation
- GitHub repository maintenance
- Demo/Presentation video

## Code Structure
The project code is organized into functional blocks for modularity and maintainability. Each major step (data extraction, transformation, database insertion, etc.) is implemented as a separate function or module.

## Workflow
1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Extract and transform the data.
3. Insert the data into a MySQL database.
4. Create and deploy the dashboard.

## Execution
1. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the main script: `python main.py`
3. Access the dashboard at the provided URL.

## Future Work
- Enhance dashboard features and interactivity.
- Incorporate machine learning for predictive analytics.
- Expand dataset and include additional metrics.
