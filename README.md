## Problem Statement
The PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository contains a large amount of data related to digital payments. The goal of this project is to extract this data, process it, and create an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends.

## Approach
1. **Data Extraction:** Clone the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository using Python scripting.
2. **Data Transformation:** Use Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
3. **Database Insertion:** Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database using mysql-connector-python.
4. **Dashboard Creation:** Use Streamlit and Plotly to create an interactive dashboard for data visualization.
5. **Data Retrieval:** Fetch data from MySQL database to dynamically update the dashboard.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy the dashboard to a web server for public access.

## Dataset
The dataset is available in the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository.

## Learning Outcomes
- Data extraction and processing
- Database management
- Visualization and dashboard creation
- Geo visualization
- Dynamic updating
- Project development and deployment

## Code Structure
The project code is organized into functional blocks for modularity and maintainability. Each major step (data extraction, transformation, database insertion, etc.) is implemented as a separate function or module.

## Workflow
1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Extract and transform the data.
3. Insert the data into a MySQL database.
4. Create and deploy the dashboard.
